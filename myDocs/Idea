Graduation Project by Sara Pellnor

Idea

My idea is to create a classic e-commerce platform that sells makeup and skincare products. I will follow an inspiration page, Maria Åkerberg, to simplify the frontend work. I will create a login page, a product page where you can also view the cart using a drawer, an order page, and a checkout page.

I will include the following elements:
• Database with users, orders, and products
• Payment solution with Stripe Checkout
• Routing and clean URLs using React Router DOM.

I will build the frontend using React and JSX. I will use MongoDB as the database for my products, users and orders. I will use Stripe as the payment solution and NodeJS and ExpressJS to create the backend. With React, it will be easy to create clean URLs.

Brief Description of Purpose

The purpose of the idea is to practice more on what I have learned during the course and have something nice and impressive to showcase on my portfolio page.
Time Estimation / Activity and Timeline
I will divide the work into sprints, with one sprint per week. Each sprint will be 40 hours, and I will work 8 hours a day, usually between 7:30 am and 4:00 pm. Below is the github project schedule:

Sprint 1 Set up database and backend – MongoDB and ExpressJS
Sprint 2 Frontend – React, URLs, and UX
Sprint 3 Stripe Checkout - Functionalities
Sprint 4 Testing and adjustments
Sprint 5 Submission/Presentation
